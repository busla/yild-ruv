; Yild stands for "Yild integrator for linked data" and is a module for
; connecting external ontologies and taxonomies to Drupal through their public
; APIs.
; Each external provider needs to be defined in its own submodule (in the
; linkdata/modules folder) and enabled. For your convenience, a handful of
; providers already exist. If you make a new one, please inform us if you think
; it could be included in the module.
